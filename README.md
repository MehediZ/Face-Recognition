# Project:		Face Recognition System.
## Project Aim:		Build a Face Recognition System Using State of Art Approach.
## Technology:		Face Recognition, Computer Vision, OpenCV, Face Encodings, Face Detection.

## Pipelines Created:		
	1.	Real Time Video Processing.
	2.	Face Detection.
	3.	Finding Facial Encodings.
	4.	Compare Facial Encodings between different faces.
	5.	Use Pretrain Model to find face distance.
	6.	Show the person name.
	7.	Try to make the system automated.
